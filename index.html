       I am a Computer Science graduate student at Stanford University. Before starting school, I was busy building <a href="https://www.blockseer.com">BlockSeer</a>, a new way to explore the Bitcoin Blockchain. Professionally, I'm interested in building the next generation of secure, scalable web applications. Academically, I'm interested in blockchain theory, computer security and economics.

        <a href="http://www.dancarlin.com/hardcore-history-series/" target="_newtab">Hardcore History</a> and the <a href="http://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com/" target="_newtab">History of Rome</a> podcasts keep me company while I'm driving.

        In my free time, I love to run, travel and read. My most recent destination was Eastern Europe and the book I am currently reading is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_in_the_Wires" target="_newtab">Ghost in the Wires</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Mitnick" target="_newtab">Kevin Mitnick</a>.
