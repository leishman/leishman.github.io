       I am a Computer Science graduate student at Stanford University specializing in computer security. My main CS passion is Bitcoin and decentralized cryptocurrencies. I'm also very interested in history, economics and love to travel.

    <p>This year I began writing for the <a href="http://stanfordreview.org/" target="_blank">Stanford Review</a>. Here are the articles I have written so far:</p>
    <ul>
