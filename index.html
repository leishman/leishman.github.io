       I am a Software Engineer at <a href="https://maicoin.com">MaiCoin</a>, building the future of money. My professional passion is working to bring digital currencies into the mainstream. Academically, I'm interested in Blockchain theory and economics.

     <p>Currently, I am working my way through Dr. Andrew Ng's Machine Learning class on Coursera. It's a fascinating and accessible course and I'd recommend it to anyone with an interest in computer science.</p>

     <p><a href="http://www.dancarlin.com/hardcore-history-series/" target="_newtab">Hardcore History</a> and the <a href="http://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com/" target="_newtab">History of Rome</a> podcasts keep me company while I'm driving.</p>

     <p>In my free time, I love to run, travel and read. My most recent destination was Saigon and the book I am currently reading is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai-Pan_%28novel%29" target="_newtab">Tai-Pan</a> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clavell" target="_newtab">James Clavell</a>.</p>

       I write about Bitcoin, software, travels and life. If you are interested in reading about my most recent shenanigans, check out my <a href="{{site.url}}/posts" class="pop">blog</a>!
