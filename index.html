       I am a Software Engineer helping build the future of money. Recently, I have been busy building <a href="https://www.blockseer.com">BlockSeer</a>, a new way to explore the Bitcoin Blockchain. Professionally, my goal is to bring digital currencies (like Bitcoin) to the mainstream. Academically, I'm interested in blockchain theory, computer security and economics.

        In Fall 2015, I will begin my graduate studies at Stanford University in the Department of Computer Science. Currently, I am working through Dr. Andrew Ng's Machine Learning class on Coursera.

        In my free time, I love to run, travel and read. My most recent destination was Saigon and the book I am currently reading is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gai-Jin" target="_newtab">Gai-Jin</a> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clavell" target="_newtab">James Clavell</a>.
