<p><span>I’ve been quite negligent of this blog for a few weeks now. I feel somewhat guilty about it, but I think it was for the better. I needed some time to reflect, think and be productive. This is what has happened since my last post:</span><br/><span></span><br/><strong>1) I went to India. </strong><br/><span></span>I took a short 5 day trip to Delhi and Agra. India is a very interesting country and I would definitely like to go back at some point with friends and more of a solid plan.</p>

<p><br/><strong>2) I spent 2 weeks in Bangkok working on my programming and Thai skills. </strong><br/><br/>Moving from place to place was wearing me out, so I decided to plant my roots and make my home in Bangkok for a few weeks. I had a great time and made some good friends at my hostel in the Silom area. I feel like a Bangkok local now and feel at home in the city.<br/><br/>My Dev Bootcamp prep work has started, so that kept me busy. I also spent some time working through a book on Metaprogramming in Ruby. <br/><br/>Trying to make the most of my time, I took 5 private Thai lessons and started catching on pretty quickly. I can count and verbalize some basic thoughts in Thai now, although I’m worried that if I don’t practice when I come home I’ll forget a lot of my vocabulary. I guess I’ll have to eat at a lot of Thai restaurants.<br/><br/>I also had some fun nights in the city, but I think it&#8217;s best if those details remain in my head.</p>
<p><br/><span>3) <strong>My parents arrived and I’m spending the next 1.5 weeks showing them around Thailand and Cambodia.</strong></span></p>
<p><span> I’ll put those updates in a new post.</span></p>
