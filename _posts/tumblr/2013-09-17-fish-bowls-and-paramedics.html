<p><span>It was a somewhat eventful day so far. My mission this morning was to make a visit to <em>Tsukiji</em> fish market to get a fish bowl, one of my favorite dishes in the world. I don&#8217;t think &#8220;fish bowl&#8221; is the official name for the dish, but it&#8217;s a fitting description for fresh sashimi sitting on top of a bed of rice in a bowl. The salmon and salmon roe combo is my favorite, so that&#8217;s what I ordered.</span><br/><span></span><br/><span>I was sitting at a bar in front of the chef preparing my meal. Right before my food was ready, the Japanese guy to my left leaned against my shoulder. Naturally, I was taken off guard and it took me a second to realize that he had lost consciousness. By the time I did, he had already slipped off my shoulder and hit the concrete headfirst. We were sitting on barstools, so he fell quite a distance.</span><br/><span></span><br/><span>I immediately had a flashback to a few months ago when a man next to me at the gym collapsed from a heart attack. Oddly, the first thought that came to my mind this time was &#8220;Crap. What are the odds of this happening again? I must be bad luck or something.&#8221;</span><br/><span></span><br/><span>Right away I jumped down to see if he was ok. The two women behind me - who I later learned were nurses from Taiwan - started attending to him as well. I felt quite helpless because nobody else spoke English and I don&#8217;t speak Japanese, but I did use hand signals to notify somebody to call an ambulance.</span><br/><span></span><br/><span>Luckily, he regained consciousness within 10 seconds and we all breathed a huge sigh of relief. He was coherent and talking to his friends in Japanese. Eventually, he got up but had to be laid down again because he felt faint.Â </span><br/><span></span><br/><span>The guy had some minor bleeding from the back of his head where he hit the pavement, but other than that he had no apparent physical trauma.</span></p>
<p>The waitress served my food while the guy was lying on the ground and the chef kept insisting that I eat it right away. I felt bad eating food while this guy was bleeding from the head, waiting for an ambulance, but what can ya do? The food was delicious:</p>

<p><span>The paramedics arrived a short time later and, presumably, took the poor guy to the hospital. I have no idea what was wrong with him but I sure am glad that he didn&#8217;t have a heart attack.</span><br/><span></span><br/><span>That was enough excitement for one day. I&#8217;m going to take it easy the rest of the day and be productive.</span></p>
