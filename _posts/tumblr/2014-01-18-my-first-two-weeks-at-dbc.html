<p>It has been a LONG while since my last blog post. I made it back from my travels and had a great Christmas season with my family.</p>
<p>On New Year&#8217;s Eve I moved to San Francisco and shortly thereafter started at Dev Bootcamp.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been in the program for two weeks now and it has been a great experience so far. The structured coursework and experienced instructors have been very effective in solidifying my programming skills. However, I find the most valuable part of DBC is the atmosphere of self-education at the school.</p>
<p>I have been staying until at least 11pm every night because I thoroughly enjoy working in this space and diving deep into concepts I find interesting and important.Â </p>
<p>The current phase of the course is focused on building up our programming skills in Ruby. This part of the course has been somewhat slow for me because I already have an engineering background, but I have had no trouble finding &#8220;stretch&#8221; exercises to do and extra side projects to work on. This extra work is what I find the most valuable anyways.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve realized that one of the best ways to solidify concepts in my head is to teach somebody else about it, so I will be using this blog as a place to describe interesting programming/tech concepts that I come across.</p>
