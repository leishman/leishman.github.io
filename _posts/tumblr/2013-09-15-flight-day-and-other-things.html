<p>Well, travel day is finally here and I&#8217;m sitting in the airport as I type this. I can&#8217;t wait to board the plane and finally get this trip started. First stop, Tokyo!<br/><br/> That said, there are definitely some people I&#8217;ll miss over the next two months, but thanks to this beautiful thing that we call the interwebs keeping in touch is as easy as pie.<br/><br/><strong><em>Maptia</em></strong><br/><br/><a href="http://maptia.com" title="Maptia">Maptia</a>, a startup with a mission to let people more effectively share their travel stories, just sent me an invitation to be an early tester! I&#8217;m really excited, as I&#8217;ve been following the founding team&#8217;s story quite closely. I first read about Maptia on <a href="http://qr.ae/NrO6P" title="Maptia on Quora">Quora</a>, where one of the founders wrote about how their team (mostly British) moved to a beach town in Morocco to save money.Â <br/><br/> They&#8217;ve developed a clean, quality product and I can&#8217;t wait to use it more thoroughly once I have some content to post from my upcoming trip.<br/><br/> The main purpose of the site is to allow users to share their experiences through text/multimedia and, soon, create their own custom maps of the world. It&#8217;s off to a great start and I&#8217;m excited to see how it will grow once it opens up to the public.<br/><br/><strong><em>Personal Projects:</em></strong><br/><br/> My <a href="http://alexleishman.com">personal site</a> is at a good place right now. I&#8217;m going to re-focus my efforts on <a href="http://maply.me" title="Maply">Maply</a>. The next step with Maply is to create an elementary version of the US map with basic information for each state. This will be targeted towards kids.</p>
<p><span>I also plan to put Maply on Rails and create an interface that allows users to toggle the map that they see. There&#8217;s so much to do!!</span></p>
