<p>Crazy bug that was driving me nuts:</p>

<p>I had a placeholder (hidden) iframe for a YouTube video with <code>src="#"</code>.<br/><script src="https://gist.github.com/leishman/38030911c2a1e0ee27a7.js"></script></p>

<p>The <code>"#"</code> was causing my layout to re-render within the iframe even though it was hidden and not displayed. This resulted in all of my assets getting loaded twice!</p>

<p>To fix this, all I needed to do was use <code>src=""</code> as the placeholder instead. I am not sure why this happens yet, but I will update this post once/if I find out.</p>
