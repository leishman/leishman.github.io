<p><span>I&#8217;m sitting in my hostel in <em>Silom</em> watching the Tuk Tuks zoom by and the rain cover Bangkok in sporadic torrents, yet somehow everything still feels very peaceful. This is what I love about traveling in Southeast Asia - the relaxed atmosphere and the opportunity to sit, think and clear your mind.</span><br/><span></span><br/><span>However, I can&#8217;t say I have a clear mind. I&#8217;ve got a lot of mixed feelings and I need to spend some time figuring everything out. Although I&#8217;ve made some programming progress, it has not been as much as I had hoped for. Balancing my desire to explore the places I visit with my desire to improve my craft hasn&#8217;t been easy. Every time I feel like I get settled somewhere, I&#8217;ve got a flight somewhere else.Â </span><br/><span></span><br/><span>But, today I promised myself I would spend 3 hours being productive and I will. Writing this does not count as productive for me. It&#8217;s too easy to use this blog as an excuse to eschew my difficult programming priorities.</span></p>
<p>I&#8217;m just saying all of this publicly to keep myself accountable. It helps.</p>
