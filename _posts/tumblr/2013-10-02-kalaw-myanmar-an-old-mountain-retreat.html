<p><span>I&#8217;m spending the night in Kalaw, a hill-station town used by the British as a summer retreat. The town lies in the mountains at 1320m, just north-west of Inlay Lake. The fresh mountain breeze is very refreshing.</span></p>

<p><span>There is not much to do here, as most people come to the town as a starting point on a trek down to Inlay Lake. I&#8217;m just chilling here and spent some time walking around. The market is nothing to write home about, but </span><span>seems to be part of the center of town.</span></p>

<p><span>There is only one main road lined with shops and restaurants. It&#8217;s a very quiet place.</span></p>
<p><span>There seems to be a small Indian population here, as there is a Sikh temple and a few Indian restaurants.</span></p>

<p><span>I ate at one of the Indian places and it was quite delicious. The proprietor said his parents were from south India, but he was born in Myanmar. </span></p>

<p>It may not apply to this man&#8217;s situation, but I did learn that there are a large number of Indian people in Myanmar because they are descendants of Indian troops that came here during the era of British rule.</p>
