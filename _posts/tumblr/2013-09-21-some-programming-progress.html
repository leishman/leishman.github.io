<p>I&#8217;ve made some progress with <a href="http://maply.me" title="Maply">Maply</a>, although I haven&#8217;t been as productive as I would like. Tokyo has been distracting me from work a bit, but I&#8217;m hoping to put in a good full day or two when I get to Bangkok.<br/><br/> I&#8217;ve gotten to the point where I can take any type of data and make dynamic charts using <a href="http://d3js.org">d3.js</a> in a modal window. This was a big step and was surprisingly easy to do. Next, I have to find a good dataset and figure out the most effective way of displaying the information in a simple and intuitive fashion.<br/><br/> I&#8217;ve created a kids version of Maply with bare-bones information. The normal version of Maply will have more in depth data and interactive content.</p>
