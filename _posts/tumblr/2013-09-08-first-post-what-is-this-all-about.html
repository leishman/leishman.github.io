<p><span>Last Friday I quit my job as a management consultant, permanently untethering myself from any regular source of income to begin my climb (or dive?) into the tech world. </span><br/><span></span><br/><span>I wish I could say that I&#8217;m some software guru who has tech firms slobbering over him. I wish I could say that I&#8217;m an entrepreneurial genius who has VC&#8217;s lining up to throw money at him. I wish I could say that I have a network of C-suite executives to tap. I wish I could simply say that I have a solid business idea. But the truth is, I&#8217;m just a guy with big dreams and not enough sense to think I can&#8217;t reach them.</span><br/><span></span><br/><em><strong>This blog will be an honest account of my personal and technological journey.</strong></em><br/><span></span><br/><span>I&#8217;ve never kept a blog before. I&#8217;m a young guy and, frankly, I&#8217;m not going to pretend to have any wisdom to impart to you. However, I recognize that my current path is unconventional and I do hope that sharing my successes and failures will be valuable to readers considering pursuing any similar endeavors. At the very least, I hope this turns into an interesting story.</span><br/><span></span><br/><span>So enough fluff already! Who am I and what the hell am I doing?</span><br/><span></span><br/><span><strong>Name</strong>: Alexander Leishman</span><br/><span><strong>Age</strong>: 23</span><br/><span><strong>Education</strong>: University of Maryland, College Park (B.S. Aerospace Engineering 2012)</span><br/><span><strong>Occupation</strong>: Funemployed</span></p>
<p><br/><strong>Background:</strong><br/> I spent the past year working for a management consulting firm. I learned a tremendous amount and met some incredible people, but I realized that it just wasn&#8217;t the right fit for me.<br/><br/> My real passion is in technology and entrepreneurship, so I decided to take a leap and apply to <a href="http://www.devbootcamp.com" title="Dev Bootcamp" target="_blank">Dev Bootcamp</a>. For some reason they accepted me and I will be starting the program on January 6th, 2013!<br/><br/> Between now and the start of the program I will spend my time traveling, programming and learning as much as I can.<br/><br/> After Dev Bootcamp I hope to find a job as a developer in the San Francisco area. My real dream, however, is to start a successful company of my own someday and I plan on working my ass off trying to make this happen.</p>
