<p><span>It&#8217;s my first morning in Tokyo and I just went on a beautiful run through <em>Asakusa </em>and along the waterfront of the <em>Sumida</em> river. As my sleep pattern is slightly out of sync with the Tokyo time zone, I woke up at 5am completely rested. </span></p>

<p><br/><span>The weather is gorgeous and this city is perfect for running. There&#8217;s a path along the river front with exercise areas and the streets are far from bustling at this hour.</span></p>
<p><span>I strayed from the path for a bit and found myself in the middle of <em>Asakusa</em> Park in front of the <em>Senso-ji</em> temple. I&#8217;d walked through here last time I visited Tokyo and had no idea my hostel was this close to such great sites.</span></p>

<p><span>I was starving at the end of the run and decided to grab a microwave meal at 7-11 because there wasn&#8217;t much else open. It was absolutely delicious.</span></p>

<p>To sum it up, my first day in Tokyo has been great so far&#8230;and it&#8217;s only 7am.</p>
