<p><strong>Non-techy stuff:</strong><br/><br/> The first leg of my Asia backpacking adventure will begin in five days. I&#8217;m very excited, but I also realize that there&#8217;s still a lot to take care of before I leave. I&#8217;ve just begun packing and I need to fit everything for two months in a backpack, so paring down my inventory is key. In all honesty, as long as I have a change of clothes, my laptop, a camera, a passport and a means to pay for things I&#8217;ll be good. All the other stuff is just extra.<br/><br/> My first stop will be Tokyo. I&#8217;ve booked a hostel in the city with good reviews so I&#8217;m quite confident I&#8217;ll meet some interesting people and have a good time. The real trick is going to be sticking to my budget because Tokyo is <em>sehr teuer</em>, as the Germans say.<br/><br/> This is my (likely) itinerary for the trip:<br/><br/><strong>Tokyo</strong>: 1.5 weeks<br/><strong>Myanmar</strong>: 2 weeks<br/><strong>India</strong>: 3 weeks<br/><strong>Thailand &amp; Cambodia</strong>: 1.5 weeks<br/><strong>Tokyo</strong>: 1 week (maybe go see Kyoto)<br/><br/> I&#8217;ve purchased a GoPro Hero3 White video camera as well as a head strap and chest harness so that I can capture footage while I&#8217;m exploring various locales. If possible, I will take the camera on my runs in each city and make mini documentaries for each place.Â <br/><br/> A friend suggested meeting locals and filming a &#8220;day in the life&#8221; kind of thing. I&#8217;m seriously considering this although I have zero film experience. It would be a great way to make friends and really understand the various cultures.<br/><br/><strong>Techy Stuff:</strong><br/><br/> So far, this week has been quite productive. I finally have my personal website up and running at <a href="http://alexleishman.com" title="Alexander Leishman Homepage" target="_blank">http://alexleishman.com</a>. This blog is now a subdomain of that site.<br/><br/> I purposely eschewed using <a href="http://getbootstrap.com" title="Twitter Bootstrap">Bootstrap</a> or any other similar tools to create the site because I wanted to build it completely from scratch as a learning exercise. I&#8217;ve written the source code of the site to be easy to follow for anybody who wants to see how I made it.<br/><br/> The design is very clean and simple, maybe to a fault. My goal was to have minimal adornment and unnecessary clutter on the page, as this is the type of site I prefer. However, I have gotten some suggestions to add pictures or more color and I will consider doing so.<br/><br/> In order to prevent the page from reloading when somebody clicks a link in the navigation bar, I used jQuery to hide and display the page content. This may or may not be the best way to do this, but it works. If anybody has any suggestions for improvements to the code or site in general, I&#8217;d love to hear them.<br/><br/><strong>On my to-do list:</strong></p>
<ul><li><span>Add a contacts page</span></li>
<li><span>Make a resume</span></li>
<li><span>Work on next round of improvements for <a href="http://maply.me">http://maply.me</a></span></li>
</ul><p><br/>Lastly, I&#8217;ve been listening to this awesome mix I found on Soundcloud!</p>
