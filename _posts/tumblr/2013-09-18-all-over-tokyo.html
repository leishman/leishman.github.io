<p>Everyone in Tokyo has to go out at least once. On Tuesday afternoon I ran into some people from California who I had met in the immigration line. They invited me to go out with them in <em>Roppongi</em> that night, so of course I took them up on it. <br/><br/>We all went out together, along with some other people from Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Holland and the UK. It was quite a fun group and we stayed out until 5am. Half of us went back to the hostel and the other half went to the fish market. I was truly impressed by their stamina.<br/><br/>The next day I wandered through <em>Shinjuku </em>and got a great bowl of Ramen. The restaurant had english translations on the menu and I couldn&#8217;t help but laugh at one of the dishes named &#8220;Jew&#8217;s Ear Ramen.&#8221; Although I was tempted to order this, I opted for the <em>Nori Ramen</em> instead.</p>

<p>After my meal, I headed to <em>Harajuku - </em>a neighborhood known for it&#8217;s cosplay contingent. Unfortunately, people only dress up on the weekends, so I&#8217;m going to have to go back in a few days to see the groups of people who imitate their favorite characters from TV shows and Manga comics.</p>
<p>As I headed into <em>Harajuku</em>, I ran into the Dutch and British friends I had gone out with the night before. They were with some Japanese people handing out free hugs, so I decided to join in on the fun. Within 3 minutes I had given out about 5 hugs, which I&#8217;d classify as a successful hugging spree. </p>

<p>The funniest hug was from an odd, little old man. His hug lasted quite a while, nearing that line where hugs stop being friendly and just become awkward.</p>

<p>After we were hugged out, we walked around <em>Harajuku</em> and saw quite a lot. I&#8217;ll write a separate post to include the photos from the rest of the day.</p>
