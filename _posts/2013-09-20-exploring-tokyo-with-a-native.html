<p><span>Yesterday, I met up with my friend Haruka, a Tokyo native, who showed me around the city. We discussed Japanese culture, food and life throughout the day and I learned a tremendous amount about the people of this country. It was my best day in Japan yet.</span><br/><span></span><br/><span>We took the Sky Hop bus to <em>Roppongi</em> Hills and had lunch at a great vegetarian restaurant. I ordered a pumpkin and brown rice dish that tasted incredible.</span></p>

<p><span>Haruka said that this neighborhood is home to many foreign businesses and wealthy expats. The luxury brands and boutique shops that surrounded us indicated that she was correct. </span></p>
<p>We then hopped on the bus to Tokyo Tower and took the elevator to the observation deck, giving us a bird&#8217;s eye view of the city. Seeing Tokyo from above gave me a whole new perspective of the metropolis I had only experienced as a lowly street pedestrian.</p>

<p><span>And of course, Japan never fails to disappoint in the slightly strange category. Among other souvenirs, they sell mayonnaise flavored crackers in Tokyo Tower.</span></p>

<p><span>After descending from our perch, we went to a famous tofu restaurant and tried the local specialty. The restaurant was located in a lush Japanese-style garden where women in a small building separate from the main restaurant sold carryout tofu. I tried a tofu ball with pickled mushrooms, which cost about </span><span>¥</span><span>300 (~$3). Despite being cold it was very flavorful and I&#8217;d definitely eat it again.</span><br/><span></span><br/><span>That was the last stop on our day trip and we parted ways when we got back to Tokyo station. I continued to ride the bus back to <em>Asakusa </em>and on the way snapped a good photo of the recently completed Tokyo Skytree.</span></p>

<p><span>I wandered around <em>Asakusa</em> after I got off of the bus and grabbed some noodle soup. In the restaurant, I met a british musician named Conrad and talked with him for a while. He&#8217;s an electronic musician and quite an interesting guy. You never know who you&#8217;ll meet when you explore a city!</span><br/><span></span><br/><span>On my way back to the hostel I couldn&#8217;t help but admire a lit up shrine I walked past. I had seen it many times in the daylight, but the night seemed to bring out a mystique that stopped me in my tracks.</span></p>
