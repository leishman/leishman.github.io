<p><span>So I&#8217;m in Yangon, Myanmar (formerly Burma), sitting here in a cafe. There is a bus stopped on the street out front and many of the passengers are staring at me through the window. </span><br/><span></span><br/><span>I flew into the city yesterday morning and met a Dutch tour guide while withdrawing money from the ATM. We decided to split a taxi into the city and right before we got in the car, he saw his friend, DaZin, from Yangon who came along with us. </span><br/><span></span><br/><span>I was heading to a hotel near the home of Marianne, the sister of a friend of my Aunt, who kindly agreed to meet me. Before I got to the hotel, I wanted to get Marianne a gift, so DaZin came with me to the shopping mall to help find a nice scarf!</span><br/><span></span><br/><span>When I arrived at my hotel, I called Marianne and learned that she had arranged a private driver and guide for me for the day!! I did not expect such incredible kindness. Her relative owns a tour company here and they helped me book and plan my itinerary for the next week and a half.</span><br/><span></span><br/><span>Marianne was busy when I landed, but she invited me for dinner that evening. During the day was time for my private tour around the city.</span><br/><span></span><br/><span>The tour guide and driver picked me up at the hotel around 11:30am and we first went to get lunch. The original plan was to take me to a good western restaurant, but I insisted on going to a local place to eat. They took me to a great spot down the street that was bustling and packed with locals.</span></p>
<p><span>The food is always served with a vegetable soup, rice and a platter of pickled and fresh veggies and herbs. Entrees are served buffet style with a vast selection of meat and vegetable dishes. We had mutton, pork, shrimp and a dish that tasted just like American corn pudding.</span></p>
<p><span>Tables are traditionally set with a container of roasted, salted nuts/beans and bitter tea leaves. You&#8217;re supposed to combine the bitter and salty flavors in your mouth. There are also typically blocks of plum sugar to nibble on for digestion.</span></p>

<p><span>After lunch, we headed to the market downtown where I sampled some local fruits. I tried mango juice/puree for the first time and it was incredible. They take mangos, smash them by hand and pour the resulting liquid over a chunk of ice (made with filtered water).</span></p>

<p>After wandering downtown and visiting the central square of the city, we went to the <em>ShweDagon</em> pagoda. This is an incredibly ornate structure visible from all over the city. It is covered in gold and is lit up at night, giving it a magical glow that truly left me in awe the first time I saw it. I&#8217;ve never seen anything like this before. Photos cannot do it justice (at least mine can&#8217;t).</p>

<p>On a side note, I&#8217;ve taken up wearing the local garment called a <em>longyi</em>. It is a tube of cloth worn tied tight at the waist and worn as a skirt by Myanmar men and women. Men tie their <em>longyis</em> in the front and women tie their&#8217;s to the side. The first time I tried it on just for fun, but then I was told that the people here truly appreciated the fact that I was following their local custom, so I decided to continue wearing it.</p>
<p>The <em>longyi </em>is quite comfortable, although the major flaw in its design is a lack of pockets. I told my tour guide I would like to create a <em>longyi </em>with pockets and she laughed, telling me that it would not look good and people would not buy such a thing. Well, I&#8217;ll show her!! Currently, one sticks their phone in the waste of the garment. I thought this would make your phone prone to theft, but they said that pickpocketing is not a problem here.</p>

<p>Marianne met me at the hotel at 6pm and took me back to her house. She used to be a professor of History at Yangon University and is currently retired and spends her time on charitable endeavors.</p>
<p>Marianne is an incredible per<span>son. In her house are 5 other females. She cares for her old nanny who is now about 85 and suffers from arthritis. Marianne also provides for a woman with two little girls whose father died from cancer. The little girls are some of the cutest and nicest kids I&#8217;ve ever met. They live with their mother in the house and help take care of Marianne, who is getting on in age.</span></p>
<p><span>When I walked in, the girls were watching Dragon Tales! Marianne provides the girls with an English tutor and I was surprised to see that they seemed understand everything I was saying to them. They&#8217;re quite bright kids.</span></p>
<p>A fourth girl lives with Marianne. She seemed to be about my age and Marianne treats her as a daughter. I believe she was an orphan and Marianne took her in.</p>
<p>The meal we had was incredible and afterwards I ate some of the best desserts I&#8217;ve ever had in my life.</p>

<p><span>I was truly touched by Marianne&#8217;s kindness and I really hope that I can repay her some day. She even invited me to her house for tea later this afternoon. I&#8217;m really overwhelmed by everything she&#8217;s done.</span></p>
<p><span>I&#8217;m heading to Bagan early tomorrow morning and I&#8217;m quite excited!</span></p>
