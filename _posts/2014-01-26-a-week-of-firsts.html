<p>This was a week of some big firsts for me. I created my first Ruby Gem and also my first API.</p>

<p>The Ruby Gem is called LyricGenius and returns lyrics and song information based on a user query. The Gem is powered by Mechanize, a powerful web scraper/crawler that itself is powered by the famous Nokogiri Gem.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/leishman/lyricgenius">LyricGenius</a> works by submitting the user query on RapGenius.com. It then selects the top result and scrapes the respective song page for the lyrics, title and artist. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/leishman/rap_genius_api">API</a> is powered by the gem and returns a JSON object with the aforementioned attributes. I built the API using Sinatra, which is like a super-lightweight Rails. It is currently hosted on <a href="http://mysterious-waters-6010.herokuapp.com/cold">Heroku</a>.</p>

<p>Programming these tools were great learning experiences. The code itself is quite simple, but it was a great exercise to get familiar with building a hosted API and Ruby Gem.</p>

<p>Now that I got my toes wet without getting hurt, I feel much more comfortable building more complex Gems and API&#8217;s to power my own and other people&#8217;s web applications.</p>

<p>I have some great ideas and I am excited to get started coding them up.</p>
